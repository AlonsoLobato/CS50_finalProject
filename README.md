## Money Funnel - A Flask web application to track project progress status

Money Funnel is a project tracking web app in which users can create and categorise their own projects and set their current status. 

### Technologies used to built this webapp:
1. Python as general programming language
2. Flask as web server framework
3. SQLite as database
3. HTML and CSS for frontend user interface
5. Javascript as front end language

This project is the Hardvar's CS50 course final project. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Money Funnel is used for tracking project that users may be working on and allows to categorise their status in:
1. Active projects
2. Projects awaiting for payment
3. Finished or paid projects

Users can also see a summary of all projects, sort them by date, client name, price, status, etc.
The web app works based on a database and a set of queries. Depending on these queries (project status) the project would appear in different sections of the webapp.

Money Funnel is free, open source and extensible to suit your personal needs.
Money Funnel was created as final project for CS50, Harvard's intro course to computer science.
