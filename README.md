### What is Money Funnel?

Money Funnel is used for tracking project that users may be working on and allows to categorise their status in:

Users can also see a summary of all projects, sort them by date, client name, price, status, etc.
The web app works based on a database and a set of queries. Depending on these queries (project status) the project would appear in different sections of the webapp.
