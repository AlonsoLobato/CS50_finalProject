CS50 Final Project - Money Funnel
---------------------------------

Money Funnel is a project tracking web app in which users can create and categorise their own projects.

Technologies used to built this webapp:
1. Python
2. Flask
2. SQLite
3. HTML
4. CSS
5. Javascript

---------------------------------

Money Funnel is used for tracking project that users may be working on and allows to categorise their status in:
1. Active projects
2. Projects awaiting for payment
3. Finished or paid projects

Users can also see a summary of all projects, sort them by date, client name, price, status, etc.
The web app works based on a database and a set of queries. Depending on these queries (project status) the project would appear in different sections of the webapp.

Money Funnel is free, open source and extensible to suit your personal needs.
Money Funnel was created as final project for CS50, Harvard's intro course to computer science.

---------------------------------

How to use it:

- users can register with name, email, username and password. The password must be re-enter for validation and is hashed for security
- users can create as many projects as they want. The info required is project name, client name, year and month of the project, price and current status
- the project status can be changed from active to waiting for payment and from waiting for payment to paid
- according to their status, projects will appear in the active project page, waiting for payment page or finished page
- there is also a summary page with all the project regardless of their status
- the tables on each page can be sorted by columns (alphabetically or lower to greater if a numeric column) by clicking on the column name. A second click will reverse the order.
